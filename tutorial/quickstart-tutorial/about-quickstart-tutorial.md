# The quickstart tutorial template

The quickstart or `Hello World!` tutorial is for introducing your users to your product or framework for the first time. Users can typically complete these tutorials in less than 15 minutes. It's task-based and installation-focused.

If you're writing a tutorial that's code focused, you might use this section to explain what commands users need to run from the terminal to install your product.

## Steps

The steps section is where you describe what the user needs to do. For a quickstart tutorial, you can walk the user through installing your product and then completing a small project to verify their installation.

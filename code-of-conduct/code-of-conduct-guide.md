# Code of Conduct template guide

---
Thank you for downloading the Code of Conduct template from The Good Docs Project!
We welcome any kind of feedback on our templates, both positive and negative.

This is the guide that explains how to use the Good Docs Project Code of Conduct template and the supplementary templates.

The Code of Conduct template includes:

- A `template-code-of conduct.md` file that you can use to create your community's public-facing Code of Conduct.
- A `template-code-of-conduct-response.md` file that you can use to create and explain the response policy and procedures your team will follow as you handle Code of Conduct incidents. This template is included in the same folder as the Code of Conduct template.
- A `template-code-of-conduct-incident-record.md` file for a form that is filled out when a community moderator takes an incident report from a community members. This template is included in the same folder as the Code of Conduct template.
- A `template-code-of-conduct-remediation-record.md` file for a form that is filled out when a community moderator meets with a community member to explain the consequences of a Code of Conduct violation. This template is included in the same folder as the Code of Conduct template.
- A `template-our-team.md` file that you can use to let community members know who they can contact to report a Code of Conduct violation. This document is not only necessary for Code of Conduct violations. It is a core document that helps you clearly communicate who belongs to your open source project or organization.


## Why do I need a Code of Conduct and a response plan?
A Code of Conduct is a lot like a good insurance policy: hopefully you won't have to use it because your community will always be healthy, productive, and inclusive.
However, if or when a problem occurs in your community, you'll be glad that your Code of Conduct is there to support you.

A Code of Conduct has many purposes and benefits. It can:

- Help you define and clearly communicate your organization's mission, values, and guiding principles.
- Encourage members of your community to behave ethically and inclusively.
- Make your community a better place to collaborate and work.
- Demonstrate to prospective community members that your community is one that is welcoming and safe to join.

But it's not enough to merely have a Code of Conduct.
You should also have a clear plan for how your team will respond if a Code of Conduct incident occurs.
Your response plan should include important details, such as:

- How incidents are reported and documented.
- Who will recieve and handle Code of Conduct incidents.
- How incidents are investigated and resolved.
- How you will handle appeals or potential conflicts of interest.

When you have a well-defined Code of Conduct response plan in addition to a Code of Conduct, it demonstrates that your community takes its ethical responsibilities seriously.
It means that you are willing to do more than simply talk about your community values: you will actively live by them.

Hopefully, as you create your Code of Conduct and your response plan, your community's leaders will have many important conversations about your community values and you will carefully think through the logistics of promoting and upholding those values in your community.


## Content of the Code of Conduct template

The following sections provide guidance about how to fill out each section of the Code of Conduct template.


### About the {insert section name here} section
Next, include each section as they appear in the template with the heading 3 weight. For example, if your template includes a "Before you start" section, this heading should say "About the before your start section." And then it should provide guidance about what kind of content goes in that section and why that section might be included in the final document. If the section is optional, indicate why some documents could benefit from that section or why it might be left out. If the template user needs to make a decision about the content in that section, provide guidance about what should go into that section.


## Checklist (optional)
If it makes sense to include a checklist of the typical content required for this type of document, include that here.


## Additional resources (optional)
If youâ€™d like to point the user to any helpful guides for deeper study or if you want to acknowledge any resources that inspired you while you wrote this template, link to or cite those resources here.


## Optional sections

If your template could benefit from these sections, you may add them:
- User stories
- Nature of content
- Priorities for each quality criteria
- Implementation strategy (e.g. can this doctype be automatically generated from code?)
- Business case
- When to include? When not to include?
- Customization guidelines
- Maintenance strategy

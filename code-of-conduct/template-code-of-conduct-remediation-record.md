TIPS FOR THE COMMUNITY MODERATOR:
When meeting with a community member to explain the outcome of a Code of Conduct violation, strive for these goals:

* **Preparation** - Simply tell the community member beforehand that you wish to discuss an issue privately. Invite one other community moderator for support if needed.
* **Calmness** - When explaining what behavior prompted to Code of Conduct investigation, calmly state what the behavior was without judgment or emotion. State the impact on the incident reporter or the community.
* **Clarity** - Set a clear behavior modification plan. If possible, get the community member to agree to this plan.
* **Privacy** - Do not disclose the identity of the incident reporter or allow them to be contacted. If the community member under investigation wishes to contact the incident reporter to apologize, explain that you can take the apology on their behalf. With your permission, a public apology may be acceptable under the circumstances.

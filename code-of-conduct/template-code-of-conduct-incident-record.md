TIPS FOR THE COMMUNITY MODERATOR:
When gathering information from an incident reporter, strive for these goals:

* **Safety** - Bring in another community moderator if something about the situation is unsafe or dangerous, but avoid inviting too many moderators into the discussion and overwhelming the incident reporter.
* **Privacy** - Where possible, always strive to uphold the incident reporter's privacy. Obtain permission to proceed with the investigation.
* **Empathy** - Be an understanding, active listener who recognizes the real emotions being felt by the incident reporter. For example, say: "It sounds like you felt (this emotion) when (this thing happened)."
* **Support** - Ask if there's anything you can do to make the incident reporter feel safe, emotionally whole, or restored. Explain the possible outcomes that are available, as provided in the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) (correction, warning, temporary ban, permanent ban). However, avoid making any direct promises for exactly how the report will be handled until the investigation is concluded.
* **Acknowledgment** - At the end of the meeting, thank the incident reporter for being part of the community and for reaching out about the incident. Let the reporter know that you will be in touch to explain how the incident will be resolved after the investigation is complete.

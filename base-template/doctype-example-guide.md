# Doctype example guide

This guide explains how to build a good example document for a specific `doctype`, which aligns with the principles of [The Good Docs Project](https://thegooddocsproject.dev).

The guide is designed to be read by a template author, someone who intends to create or improve a set of templates and guides for a `doctype`.

## Prerequisites

To make the best use of this guide, you should have a working knowledge of:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/): The version control system used.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/thegooddocsproject): The project hosting platform used, along with associated project management tools.
* [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/): The markup language used to write template documentation.
* Technical writing, including experience writing for the doctype you are writing an example for.

## Fictional example project

The xxx-example.md document should describe the fictional [chronologue](https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/chronologue/) project.

We've chosen to use a common example project to reduce cognitive load on the reader, and to help build a common theme between templates.

A fictional project was chosen over a real example because:
* The fictional project's characteristics can remain static over time, ensuring examples don't need to be updated.
* Characteristics can be invented to illustrate a specific feature.
* We avoid having the select a "favorite" exemplar project, and upsetting non-selected projects. 
* Examples and features can be a little whimsical, adding a little entertainment to the reading. Note, any whimsical additions should not come at the expense of legibility for the wide target audience.

The `chronologue time machine` concept was chosen because:
* It is obviously fake.
* It is technical, and hence needs technical documentation.
* It lends itself to adding some whimsical fun.

## Best practices in writing examples

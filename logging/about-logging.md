# The Logging Article

### When Do I Need a Logging Article?

Logging articles are a special type of template that is used only to describe log pipelines specific to your application.

This article type aligns itself closely with the Reference content type, so the same content guidelines apply.

## Content of Your Logging Article

### About the "Description" Section

The description section gives the reader all the key information they need to understand what the logging entry is and how it is structured.

You complete the sections as they relate to your logs and logging pipelines.

You don't need to describe the mandatory logging parameters sent by default to the log pipeline. Define these parameters in higher-level reference documentation for your project.

Only describe the parameters unique to your application or common parameters that are being reused from other applications.

### About the "Logging example" Section

If you get called late at night and you're trying to debug a problem, not knowing how to interpret a logfile because there is no example of what to expect is extremely frustrating.

If you can describe what you will see in the log file, it will be immensely helpful to the person trying to fix a critical issue at 2 am in the morning.

### About the "Log properties" Section

If you have the concept of mandatory and app-specific log properties, you can specify app-specific log properties in this section.

The biggest tip for writing logging articles is to be as descriptive as possible with each logging parameter.
Think about why you would want to query this parameter in the logs and what insights or benefits the parameter adds to the log.

# The discussion article

## When do I need a discussion article?

Discussions, or explanations, explain background information and provide context-specific knowledge on a particular topic.

The goals of a discussion article are understanding-oriented, not procedural or learning.

Discussion articles work well when they deliver the following types of information:

* They give context to a subject or topic that your audience may not have
* They explain the "why" about a topic that may not be evident in reference or how-to articles
* They suggest alternative approaches or different ways of thinking about a customer challenge or technical topic
* They allow your audience to make connections between related concepts so they can form a better understanding of the subject.

## Content of your discussion article

### About the "Overview" section

Summarize what the reader will get from reading the discussion article.

Creating a good overview comes down to thinking about who is going to be using it:

* Are you writing only for end-users? For developers?
* Are you writing only for people who have a certain problem to solve?
* Is it intended for a particular industry.

### About the "Glossary" section

If you plan on using a whole lot of terms that might not be familiar to your readers, list them all in this section.

Declaring them here lets you use any abbreviated forms of the terminology you're using in the body of the discussion

### Structuring discussion articles

Think about structuring discussion topics like you would a presentation to a group of folks who don't know anything about your chosen subject.
Your discussion should introduce ideas gradually so your audience can grow their understanding of the concepts in your discussion.

It can be easy to blend discussions with other types of content, like how-to or reference articles.
Here are a few tips to avoid mixing documentation types:

* Avoid instructions, procedures, or any content that doesn't focus solely on building upon the conceptual understanding of the discussion topic.
* If you find yourself writing steps or describing how to do something in detail in your discussion article, chances are you need to shift your focus away from the "doing" and remind yourself of the main goals.

Here are some clues that your discussion article is not staying on-topic:

| Clue | Solution |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| You start to write steps to achieve something that you're describing in your topic. | Look for opportunities to link to other topics that complement your discussion content. Link to these articles in-line or at the end of the document in the "Where to next" section. |
| You think that inserting a tutorial video about the discussion item directly into the discussion is necessary. | Link to the video in the "Where to next" section, so your audience doesn't get distracted by the video. |
| You begin including YAML and JSON structures of end-points that you can call in your conceptual API discussion. | You are mixing too much reference content into your discussion article. Bring the focus back to understanding the structures, not documenting all the things you can do with them. If your discussion article still needs to link back to the API, you can add the link with a brief explanation to the Related Articles section.  |
